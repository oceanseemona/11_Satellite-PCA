Practical Implementation of PCA on Satellite Images 

OBJECTIVE:

• To compute the principal components on satellite images which consists of four bands and display the principal component image for visualisation purpose.

DATASET :

• Four satellite images of Kolkata (Rband, Gband, Bband and Iband) are given with equal image size (512 * 512). Those images are attached in the zip file with names band1, band2, band3 and band4.
• The feature vector dimension is 4.

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

>NumPy
command prompt: pip install numpy

>Sklearn
command prompt: pip install sklearn

>Matplotlib
command prompt: pip install matplotlib

>Jupyter Notebook
command prompt: pip install jupyter

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, which already has the above packages.

OUTPUT:

Four output images using histogram equalization are shown for four principal components PC1, PC2, PC3 and PC4.
